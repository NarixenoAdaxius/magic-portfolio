## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was creating a website that effectively represents the vibrant community and professional standards of the ALPHA organization. Balancing visual appeal with functionality required careful consideration of user experience and organizational branding.

Coordinating with a team of 10 developers presented unique collaboration challenges. We implemented robust version control workflows and established clear coding standards to ensure consistency across the codebase. Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions helped maintain quality while fostering knowledge sharing among team members.

Another significant learning was optimizing the website for community engagement. Integrating Discord seamlessly while maintaining a professional web presence required thoughtful UX design and technical implementation to bridge the gap between formal organizational representation and casual community interaction.

The responsive design implementation across various devices taught us valuable lessons about modern CSS techniques and mobile-first development approaches, especially when working with complex animations and interactive elements.
