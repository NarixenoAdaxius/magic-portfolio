- **Entity Framework**: For efficient database operations and object-relational mapping.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was designing a POS system that could handle the complexity of PC component sales while remaining intuitive for staff to use. PC components have various compatibility requirements, specifications, and pricing tiers that needed to be properly managed and displayed.

Implementing real-time inventory tracking presented technical challenges, especially ensuring data consistency across multiple workstations and preventing overselling of limited stock items. We learned valuable lessons about database optimization and concurrent access management.

Another significant challenge was creating a flexible pricing system that could handle different markup strategies for various product categories, bulk discounts, and special pricing for repeat customers. This required careful database design and business logic implementation.

The Material Design implementation in XAML also required extensive customization to create a desktop experience that felt both modern and familiar to retail staff, bridging the gap between mobile design principles and desktop application requirements.

## Outcome

DPCPOS is now partially deployed and actively used by Dream PC Builds and IT Solutions for their daily operations. The system has significantly improved operational efficiency, reduced manual errors in inventory management, and provided valuable business insights through comprehensive reporting features. Staff training was minimal due to the intuitive Material Design interface, and the system has proven reliable and fast in high-transaction environments. The custom-built solution perfectly matches the business requirements and continues to support the company's growth in the PC building and IT services market.
