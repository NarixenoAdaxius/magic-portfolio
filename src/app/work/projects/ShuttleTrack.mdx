## Overview

ShuttleTrack is an innovative fleet tracking solution designed for shuttle services in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines. This IoT-powered system utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to provide real-time tracking and monitoring of shuttle vehicles across the city. The project achieved finalist status in the IoT Conference, demonstrating its potential impact on urban transportation management and passenger convenience.

## Key Features

- **Real-time GPS Tracking**: Live location monitoring of shuttle vehicles with precise positioning using Google Maps integration.
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: Long-range, low-power wireless communication ensuring reliable data transmission across the metropolitan area.
- **3D Interactive Maps**: Immersive 3D mapping interface providing detailed route visualization and shuttle positioning.
- **Shuttle Information Display**: Comprehensive shuttle details including route information, capacity status, and estimated arrival times.
- **Fleet Management Dashboard**: Administrative interface for monitoring multiple shuttles, route optimization, and operational analytics.
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant notifications and updates on shuttle status, delays, and route changes.
- **Offline Capability**: Cached data functionality ensuring app usability during network interruptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**: Primary development environment for native Android application development.
- **Kotlin**: Modern programming language for robust, concise, and safe Android app development.
- **Firestore**: Cloud-based NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization and storage.
- **Google Maps API**: Advanced mapping services for location tracking, route visualization, and navigation features.
- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller platform for IoT device development and LoRaWAN integration.
- **LoRaWAN**: Long Range Wide Area Network protocol for efficient, long-distance wireless communication.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was integrating LoRaWAN technology with Arduino UNO devices to create a reliable communication network across Mandaluyong's urban environment. Optimizing signal strength and data transmission efficiency required extensive field testing and antenna positioning adjustments to overcome urban interference and building obstacles.

Developing real-time synchronization between the Arduino-powered tracking devices and the Android application presented significant technical hurdles. We implemented robust data parsing algorithms and established efficient communication protocols to ensure accurate location data reaches the mobile app with minimal latency.

Creating an intuitive user interface that displays complex fleet information in an accessible format required careful UX/UI design considerations. The 3D mapping implementation demanded optimization for various Android device specifications while maintaining smooth performance and visual appeal.

Managing power consumption of the LoRaWAN Arduino devices was crucial for practical deployment. We optimized transmission intervals and implemented sleep modes to extend battery life while maintaining real-time tracking accuracy for operational requirements.

## Outcome

ShuttleTrack successfully demonstrated its potential at the IoT Conference, achieving finalist status among competing transportation technology solutions. The system proved capable of tracking multiple shuttle vehicles simultaneously across Mandaluyong with reliable LoRaWAN connectivity and real-time data visualization.

The Android application provided users with accurate, up-to-date shuttle information, significantly improving passenger experience through predictable arrival times and route transparency. The 3D mapping interface received positive feedback for its intuitive design and comprehensive route visualization capabilities.

The project established a foundation for scalable urban transportation tracking systems, demonstrating how LoRaWAN technology can be effectively implemented in metropolitan fleet management. The collaborative development process strengthened our team's expertise in IoT integration, mobile development, and real-time data systems.

The success of ShuttleTrack has opened opportunities for further development and potential commercial implementation, with interest from local transportation authorities for expanding the system to cover broader metropolitan areas and additional vehicle types.
