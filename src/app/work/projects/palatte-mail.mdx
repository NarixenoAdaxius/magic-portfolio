## Overview

Palette Mail is a developer-friendly email builder that allows you to create stunning, responsive emails in minutes. It's designed to be easy to use for both no-code users and developers, with a focus on providing a professional look and feel. It is developed due to the need of a simple and easy to use email builder for the company's email marketing needs.

## Key Features

- **Template Builder**: Create emails that reflect your unique brand and style. Your emails, your way - with professional results every time.
- **Theming and Customization**: Personalize every aspect of your emails with custom fonts, colors, images, and layouts. Code or No Code. No Problem.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protect your account with Palette Mail Authentication for an extra layer of security using two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator/Authy/Microsoft Authenticator.
- **Email Management**: Developed a comprehensive email management system that allows you to manage your emails, contacts, and settings.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Radix UI**: For building a modern, accessible, and reusable component library.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing user data,email templates, contacts, and settings.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending emails.
- **React Hook Form**: For handling form submissions.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was designing a flexible email builder that balanced ease of use with advanced customization. Creating an interface that worked seamlessly for both no-code users and developers required careful planning, user testing, and iterative design.

Implementing two-factor authentication also presented some technical hurdles, particularly around integrating third-party authenticator apps in a secure yet user-friendly way. We learned a lot about security best practices and authentication flows during this process.

Another key learning was optimizing the real-time preview and template rendering performance. Handling live updates while maintaining design accuracy across devices led us to explore smarter rendering techniques and more efficient state management.

Lastly, close collaboration between development and design teams using Figma and Git workflows helped streamline feedback loops and ensure consistency between code and design—an essential part of building a polished product.



## Outcome

 Palette Mail is now fully functional and actively being used to design, manage, and send beautiful, responsive emails. Core features such as the template builder, theming system, authentication, and contact management are stable and production-ready. While the platform remains in continuous development—with more enhancements, integrations, and refinements on the roadmap—it already provides a reliable and developer-friendly environment for building modern email experiences. The solid foundation ensures that future improvements can be introduced without disrupting current functionality.
